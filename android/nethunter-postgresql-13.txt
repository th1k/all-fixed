Solution:
All you need to do is run:

sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y 
Now run this, you HAVE to run these together or it will not work:

rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/info/postgresql* && dpkg --configure -a
You need to run this again to upgrade the package

sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
