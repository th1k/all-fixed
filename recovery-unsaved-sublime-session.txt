Where does Sublime Text store its un-saved windows?

* Windows
For the settings folder you could look for a unique file using:
F:\>dir license.sublime_license /s /b

* Windows 7

- Sublime Text 2:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Settings

- Sublime Text 3:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Local

* Windows 7 64bit, Sublime Text 3 saves its working session (including the contents of tabs that were unsaved when the application was closed) to:
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Local\Session.sublime_session
