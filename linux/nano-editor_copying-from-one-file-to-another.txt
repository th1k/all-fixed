Copy text from one file to another with nano text editor

Note: To help you understand better, we will use a

source file: /var/named/athens.local

destination file: /var/named/patra.local

Open the destination file (the file that want to paste the text into), by using nano's multiple buffer.
nano -F destination_file

So we have:

nano -F /var/named/patra.local
Press Ctrl+r.

From inside nano editor, open the source file

/var/named/athens.local

Press ctrl+^ (this will enable the "mark set" mode)

Select your text.

When you have marked all the text you want, copy the text to

clipboard by pressing Alt+^

Note: Now your text is in clipboard.

Note: In help file you will see the Alt+^ described as M-^. 
Press ctrl+x, to close the source file (/var/named/athens.local).

Now we will see the destination file (/var/named/patra.local).

Move the cursor to the place you want to paste the copied text (which is

in buffer, don't forget that).

Press ctrl+u, to paste the text.

You are done.
