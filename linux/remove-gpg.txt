#Remove GPG In Linux

First you need to find the key id of the key you added. Do this by the command:
 
sudo apt-key list
 
It will list all the keys that you have, with each entry looking like this:
 
pub   1024R/B455BEF0 2010-07-29
uid                  Launchpad clicompanion-nightlies
 
Once you have figured out which key to remove, use the command sudo apt-key del <keyid> where <keyid> is replaced with the actual keyid of the key you want to remove from your keyring.
 
$ sudo apt-key del B455BEF0
$ apt-key list | grep clicompan
 
=================================
 
On 16.10 the short key id is no longer shown when you use the list command, but it is actually the last 8 characters of the long hex.
 
So for example the key id for the following key
 
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ubuntu-keyring-2012-cdimage.gpg
------------------------------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2012-05-11 [SC]
      8439 38DF 228D 22F7 B374  2BC0 D94A A3F0 EFE2 1092 ==> this 8 digits
uid           [ unknown] Ubuntu CD Image Automatic Signing Key (2012) <cdimage@ubuntu.com>
 
The key id will be EFE21092 ==> this 8 digits
