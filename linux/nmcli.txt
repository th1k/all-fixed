#Connect wifi using nmcli (raspberry pi)

I think you want to keep using managed interface (by NetworkManager). nmcli is a command‚Äêline tool for controlling NetworkManager.

To see list of saved connections, use (<SavedWiFiConn>)

nmcli c
To see list of available WiFi hotspots (<WiFiSSID>)

nmcli d wifi list
or:

sudo iwlist <WifiInterface> scanning
To see list of interfaces (<WifiInterface>)

ifconfig -a
Just change <WifiInterface>, <WiFiSSID>, <WiFiPassword> in the following commands to reflect your setup. If WiFi info already saved, easier way using <SavedWiFiConn> name of connection as it was saved in NetworkManager.

Ubuntu 16.04
##disconnect
nmcli d disconnect <WifiInterface>

##connect
nmcli d connect <WifiInterface>
Another way:

##disconnect
nmcli c down <SavedWiFiConn>

##connect
nmcli c up <SavedWiFiConn>
Ubuntu 15.10 & previous
##disconnect
nmcli d disconnect iface <WifiInterface>

##connect
nmcli d wifi connect <WiFiSSID> password <WiFiPassword> iface <WifiInterface>
Another way:

##disconnect:
nmcli c down id <SavedWiFiConn>

##connect:
nmcli c up id <SavedWiFiConn>
If your password isn't automatically recognized type this:

nmcli -a c up <SavedWiFiConn>

Note: If there are spaces in the command line, you should use quotes:

nmcli device wifi connect "my homewifi" password mypass

This will let the shell and nmcli know that this is to be considered as one word.
